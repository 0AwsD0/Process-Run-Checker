# Process Run Checker
Simple app to check if process is running.
I made this program for myself to check if process is dead. 
The game I played after playing some time would crash completely. No debug info, no message. Window just disappeared. So to test possible solutions and not waste my time, I went and changed settings in game than moved in into tray and moved on to do some other things. Since I have multiple monitors, I had my process checker on the second one, and if process died I would know that options I changed didn't help. So yeah. Maybe somebody will find it somewhat useful.
- you can set interval time - how often app checks state of process
- you can obviously set process name (remember don't include '.exe' only process name)
- it have nice design  - small window not taking too much space, and dark (not too dark) appearance
- you can select checkbox to play windows 'beep' sound whenever process died
